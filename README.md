# Handwritten_DigitRecognition
Handwritten digit recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and machine learning is a fascinating application. This project involves two main components: uploading an image for prediction and live image recognition.
Here's a detailed content outline:

## Technologies Used:
     - Python programming language
     - TensorFlow and Keras for building and training the CNN
     - Machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn

## Dataset Overview:
   - MNIST dataset of Handwritten Digits.

## Model Architecture:
   - CNN architecture used for handwritten digit recognition.

## Training the Model:
   - Training process includes data preprocessing, model compilation, and fitting.
Here, The digits are recognized using either from Image uploaded or live through camera.
